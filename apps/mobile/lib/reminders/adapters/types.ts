/**
 * Delivery adapter contract (task 09-30 design §4) — one adapter per
 * platform, selected once in `adapters/index.ts`:
 *
 * - `native` (iOS / Android): expo-notifications — OS-persisted scheduling
 *   (the notification still fires after the app is force-killed);
 * - `tauri` (desktop webview): tauri-plugin-notification — in-session
 *   delivery only (the desktop plugin cannot schedule, research-verified);
 * - `web` (plain browser): no-op (R6).
 *
 * The hook (`hooks/use-reminder-delivery.ts`) is the only consumer. The
 * adapters are THIN wrappers over the platform modules — the pure decision
 * logic (which rows to schedule / cancel / fire) lives in
 * `reminder-scheduler.ts` and is unit-tested there.

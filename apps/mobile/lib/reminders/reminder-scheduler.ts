/**
 * Reminder reconcile — the pure, platform-free decision function
 * (task 09-30 design §3). The unit-test core of the delivery layer.
 *
 * Compares the local `reminders` table (live `state='scheduled'` rows with
 * their resolved action titles — `listScheduledReminders` from
 * `@nextdo/db`) against the OS-side notification state (the set of pending
 * reminder ids, reported by the delivery adapter) and produces an IDEMPOTENT
 * set of operations:
 *
 * Native mode (iOS / Android — OS-persisted scheduling):
 *   1. Future row (fires_at > now) + not yet pending + has title → schedule;
 *   2. Orphan row (title null — the action row is gone) with a pending
 *      notification → cancel; the row itself stays in the DB untouched
 *      (v1 writes no fired/cancelled state here — R7);
 *   3. Pending id with no matching scheduled row (the business transaction
 *      already cancelled it) → cancel;
 *   4. Past rows (fires_at <= now) are never (re)scheduled — no late
 *      catch-up delivery (R7); if one still has a pending notification it
 *      is left to fire naturally (it is OS-persisted and will sound at its
 *      own time).
 *
 * Tauri mode (desktop — no native scheduling; in-session delivery through
 * the hook's 30 s tick):
 *   1. Row whose fires_at has passed within the trailing GRACE window, has
 *      a title, and was not already delivered this session → fire now;
 *   2. Rows past by more than GRACE → never delivered (missed while the
 *      app was closed — the Now screen shows the overdue action instead);
 *      future rows wait for the tick that crosses fires_at;
 *   3. No cancel operations (desktop has no OS-side pending state).
 *
 * Idempotency (AC7): re-running with the same inputs AFTER the operations
 * were applied (pendingIds now include the scheduled rows) yields empty
 * outputs — start/foreground churn never duplicates a schedule.
 *
 * No platform / React imports in this file — it is the unit-test subject.
 * `now` is injected (hook-guidelines: the engine receives the clock as a
 * parameter).

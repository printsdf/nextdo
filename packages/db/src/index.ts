/**
 * @nextdo/db — PowerSync client schema + Kysely queries + connector.
 * The ONLY PowerSync-client touchpoint in the monorepo (design.md §3).
 *
 * Public surface:
 *   - schema.ts: `AppSchema` (the PowerSync schema — single source of
 *     truth for all client tables)
 *   - powersync.ts: platform client selection (`createPowerSyncDatabase`),
 *     the v2 backend connector (`createPowerSyncConnector`), the single
 *     stream subscription (`subscribeAppStream`)
 *   - owner-token.ts: owner-token + sync-backend-config storage per the spec
 *     platform matrix (SecureStore / Stronghold / in-memory; the only
 *     client-side key-value access for auth state and the per-device sync
 *     server URLs — `getOwnerToken` / `getStoredBackendConfig` + their
 *     set/clear, `subscribeToOwnerTokenChange`)
 *   - kysely.ts: `wrapDb` — the app-facing Kysely handle over the PowerSync
 *     client (the app never imports Kysely / the driver itself)
 *   - queries/: the app's read + mutation surface (design.md §3/§4 —
 *     internal query modules are reachable only through this file,
 *     directory-structure.md Rule 3)
